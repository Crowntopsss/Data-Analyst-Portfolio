## This folder hosts all my personal projects done so far on Data Analysis.

### [Project 1 — Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/phetchareun/udacity-dand/tree/master/p1)
In this project, I conduct my own data analysis and createa file to share my findings.
This project will utilize Pandas and NumPy to answer questions I am most interested in.
The dataset chosen for this project is the Titanic dataset provided by [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

### [Project 2 — OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling Project](https://github.com/phetchareun/udacity-dand/tree/master/p2)
In this project, I perform data wrangling (munging) on a custom map area of my hometown (Champaign, IL).
The process utilizes python modules to parse, audit, clean the XML, export as .CSV files, and finally load into SQL.

### [Project 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/phetchareun/udacity-dand/tree/master/p3)
In this project, I perform an exploratory data analysis of a dataset on white wine.
The process utilizes R and the tidyverse libraries.

### [Project 4 — Inferential Statistics](https://github.com/phetchareun/udacity-dand/tree/master/p4)
In this project, I perform a hypothesis test on the [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) using a sample of participant data.

### [Project 5 — Intro to Machine Learning](https://github.com/phetchareun/udacity-dand/tree/master/p5)
In this project, I build a model to detect persons of interest from a dataset regarding the Enron scandal from the Early 2000's. Dataset is provided by Udacity.

### [Project 6 — Effective Data Visualization](https://github.com/phetchareun/udacity-dand/tree/master/p6)
In this project, I build a Tableau story utilizing toy baseball data provided by Udacity. Link to [Final Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kao.phetchareun#!/vizhome/baseball_story_v1/Story1)
